,,0.1441,rocksdb,"added missing subcodes and improved error message for missing enum values Summary: Javas `Status.SubCode` was out of sync with `include/rocksdb/status.h:SubCode`. When running out of disc space this led to an `IllegalArgumentException` because of an invalid status code, rather than just returning the corresponding status code without an exception. I added the missing status codes. By this, we keep the behaviour of throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` in case of newly added status codes that are defined in C but not in Java. We could think of an alternative strategy: add in Java another code ""UnknownCode"" which acts as a catch-all for all those status codes that are not yet mirrored from C to Java. This approach would never throw an exception but simply return a non-OK status-code.

Dynamic libraries are populated via the Env::LoadLibrary method. The addition of dynamic library support allows for a few different features to be developed: 1. The compression code can be changed to use dynamic library support. This would allow RocksDB to determine at run-time what compression packages were installed. This change would eliminate the need to make sure the build-time and run-time environment had the same library set. It would also simplify some of the Java build issues (where it attempts to build and include various packages inside the RocksDB jars). 2. Along with other features (to be provided in a subsequent PR), this change would allow code/configurations to be added to RocksDB at run-time. For example, the build system includes code for building an ""rados"" environment and adding ""Cassandra"" features. Instead of these extensions being built into the base RocksDB code, these extensions could be loaded at run-time as required/appropriate, either by configuration or explicitly. We intend to push out other changes in support of the extending RocksDB at run-time via configurations.

,,0.5026,rocksdb,"Simplify migration to FileSystem API (#6552) Summary: The current Env/FileSystem API separation has a couple of issues 1. It requires the user to specify 2 options ```Options::env``` and ```Options::file_system``` which means they have to make code changes to benefit from the new APIs. Furthermore, there is a risk of accessing the same APIs in two different ways, through Env in the old way and through FileSystem in the new way. The two may not always match, for example, if env is ```PosixEnv``` and FileSystem is a custom implementation. Any stray RocksDB calls to env will use the ```PosixEnv``` implementation rather than the file_system implementation. 2. There needs to be a simple way for the FileSystem developer to instantiate an Env for backward compatibility purposes. This PR solves the above issues and simplifies the migration in the following ways 1.

In this case, previous RocksDB will just fail the recovery and return a non-ok status. This PR enables another possibility. During recovery, RocksDB checks possible MANIFEST files, and try to recover to the most recent state without missing table file. `VersionSet::Recover()` applies version edits incrementally and ""materializes"" a version only when this version does not reference any missing table file. After processing the entire MANIFEST, the version created last will be the latest version. `DBImpl::Recover()` calls `VersionSet::Recover()`. Afterwards, WAL replay will *not* be performed. To use this capability, set `options.best_efforts_recovery true` when opening the db. Best-efforts recovery is currently incompatible with atomic flush.

In this case, previous RocksDB will just fail the recovery and return a non-ok status. This PR enables another possibility. During recovery, RocksDB checks possible MANIFEST files, and try to recover to the most recent state without missing table file. `VersionSet::Recover()` applies version edits incrementally and ""materializes"" a version only when this version does not reference any missing table file. After processing the entire MANIFEST, the version created last will be the latest version. `DBImpl::Recover()` calls `VersionSet::Recover()`. Afterwards, WAL replay will *not* be performed. To use this capability, set `options.best_efforts_recovery true` when opening the db. Best-efforts recovery is currently incompatible with atomic flush.

,,0.6462,rocksdb,"Simplify migration to FileSystem API (#6552) Summary: The current Env/FileSystem API separation has a couple of issues 1. It requires the user to specify 2 options ```Options::env``` and ```Options::file_system``` which means they have to make code changes to benefit from the new APIs. Furthermore, there is a risk of accessing the same APIs in two different ways, through Env in the old way and through FileSystem in the new way. The two may not always match, for example, if env is ```PosixEnv``` and FileSystem is a custom implementation. Any stray RocksDB calls to env will use the ```PosixEnv``` implementation rather than the file_system implementation. 2. There needs to be a simple way for the FileSystem developer to instantiate an Env for backward compatibility purposes. This PR solves the above issues and simplifies the migration in the following ways 1. Embed a shared_ptr to the ```FileSystem``` in the ```Env```, and remove ```Options::file_system``` as a configurable option. This way, no code changes will be required in application code to benefit from the new API. The default Env constructor uses a ```LegacyFileSystemWrapper``` as the embedded ```FileSystem```. 1a. This also makes it more robust by ensuring that even if RocksDB has some stray calls to Env APIs rather than FileSystem, they will go through the same object and thus there is no risk of getting out of sync. 2. Provide a ```NewCompositeEnv()``` API that can be used to construct a PosixEnv with a custom FileSystem implementation. This eliminates an indirection to call Env APIs, and relieves the FileSystem developer of the burden of having to implement wrappers for the Env APIs. 3.

This slows down MyRocks recovery time when site is down. This PR introduces two new APIs: 1. `Env::RegisterDbPaths` and `Env::UnregisterDbPaths` lets `DB` tell the env when it starts or stops using its database directories . The `PosixFileSystem` takes this opportunity to set up a cache from database directories to the corresponding logical block sizes. 2. `LogicalBlockSizeCache` is defined only for OS_LINUX to cache the logical block sizes. Other modifications: 1. rename `logical buffer size` to `logical block size` to be consistent with Linux terms. 2. declare `GetLogicalBlockSize` in `PosixHelper` to expose it to `PosixFileSystem`. 3. change the functions `IOError` and `IOStatus` in `env/io_posix.h` to have external linkage since they are used in other translation units too. Pull Request resolved: Test Plan: 1. A new unit test is added for `LogicalBlockSizeCache` in `env/io_posix_test.cc`. 2.

For now, the patch adds a deleter template class `SimpleDeleter`, which simply casts the `value` pointer to its original type and calls `delete` or `delete[]` on it as appropriate.

Embed a shared_ptr to the ```FileSystem``` in the ```Env```, and remove ```Options::file_system``` as a configurable option. This way, no code changes will be required in application code to benefit from the new API. The default Env constructor uses a ```LegacyFileSystemWrapper``` as the embedded ```FileSystem```. 1a. This also makes it more robust by ensuring that even if RocksDB has some stray calls to Env APIs rather than FileSystem, they will go through the same object and thus there is no risk of getting out of sync. 2. Provide a ```NewCompositeEnv()``` API that can be used to construct a PosixEnv with a custom FileSystem implementation. This eliminates an indirection to call Env APIs, and relieves the FileSystem developer of the burden of having to implement wrappers for the Env APIs. 3. Add a couple of missing FileSystem APIs ```SanitizeEnvOptions()``` and ```NewLogger()``` Tests: 1.

In this case, previous RocksDB will just fail the recovery and return a non-ok status. This PR enables another possibility. During recovery, RocksDB checks possible MANIFEST files, and try to recover to the most recent state without missing table file. `VersionSet::Recover()` applies version edits incrementally and ""materializes"" a version only when this version does not reference any missing table file. After processing the entire MANIFEST, the version created last will be the latest version. `DBImpl::Recover()` calls `VersionSet::Recover()`. Afterwards, WAL replay will *not* be performed. To use this capability, set `options.best_efforts_recovery true` when opening the db. Best-efforts recovery is currently incompatible with atomic flush.

It requires the user to specify 2 options ```Options::env``` and ```Options::file_system``` which means they have to make code changes to benefit from the new APIs. Furthermore, there is a risk of accessing the same APIs in two different ways, through Env in the old way and through FileSystem in the new way. The two may not always match, for example, if env is ```PosixEnv``` and FileSystem is a custom implementation. Any stray RocksDB calls to env will use the ```PosixEnv``` implementation rather than the file_system implementation. 2. There needs to be a simple way for the FileSystem developer to instantiate an Env for backward compatibility purposes. This PR solves the above issues and simplifies the migration in the following ways 1. Embed a shared_ptr to the ```FileSystem``` in the ```Env```, and remove ```Options::file_system``` as a configurable option. This way, no code changes will be required in application code to benefit from the new API. The default Env constructor uses a ```LegacyFileSystemWrapper``` as the embedded ```FileSystem```. 1a. This also makes it more robust by ensuring that even if RocksDB has some stray calls to Env APIs rather than FileSystem, they will go through the same object and thus there is no risk of getting out of sync. 2.

In direct IO mode, read requests are aligned and merged together before being issued to RandomAccessFile::MultiRead, so blocks in the original requests might share the same underlying buffer, the shared buffers are returned in `aligned_bufs`, which is a new parameter of the `MultiRead` API. For example, suppose alignment requirement for direct IO is 4KB, one request is (offset: 1KB, len: 1KB), another request is (offset: 3KB, len: 1KB), then since they all belong to page (offset: 0, len: 4KB), `MultiRead` only reads the page with direct IO into a buffer on heap, and returns 2 Slices referencing regions in that same buffer.

This was initially convenient for introducing a new iterator and block type for new index format, while reducing code change. However, these two usage doesnt go with each other very well. For example, Prev() is never called for partitioned index iterator, and some other complexity is maintained in block based iterators, which is not needed for index iterator but maintainers will always need to reason about it. Furthermore, the template usage is not following Google C++ Style which we are following, and makes a large chunk of code tangled together. This commit separate the two iterators. Right now, here is what it is done: 1. Copy the block based iterator code into partitioned index iterator, and de-template them. 2. Remove some code not needed for partitioned index. The upper bound check and tricks are removed. We never tested performance for those tricks when partitioned index is enabled in the first place. Its unlikelyl to generate performance regression, as creating new partitioned index block is much rarer than data blocks. 3. Separate out the prefetch logic to a helper class and both classes call them. This commit will enable future follow-ups. One direction is that we might separate index iterator interface for data blocks and index blocks, as they are quite different. Pull Request resolved: Test Plan: build using make and cmake.

At the time, the global seqno of the ingested file has not yet been determined, so the cached block will not have a global seqno. When the file is ingested and we read its range tombstone metablock, it will be returned from the cache with no global seqno. In that case, we use the actual seqnos stored in the range tombstones, which are all zero, so the tombstones cover nothing. This commit removes global_seqno_ variable from Block. When iterating over a block, the global seqno for the block is determined by the iterator instead of storing this mutable attribute in Block. Additionally, this commit adds a regression test to check that keys are deleted when ingesting a file with a global seqno and range deletion tombstones.

In this case, previous RocksDB will just fail the recovery and return a non-ok status. This PR enables another possibility. During recovery, RocksDB checks possible MANIFEST files, and try to recover to the most recent state without missing table file. `VersionSet::Recover()` applies version edits incrementally and ""materializes"" a version only when this version does not reference any missing table file. After processing the entire MANIFEST, the version created last will be the latest version. `DBImpl::Recover()` calls `VersionSet::Recover()`. Afterwards, WAL replay will *not* be performed. To use this capability, set `options.best_efforts_recovery true` when opening the db. Best-efforts recovery is currently incompatible with atomic flush.

This slows down MyRocks recovery time when site is down. This PR introduces two new APIs: 1. `Env::RegisterDbPaths` and `Env::UnregisterDbPaths` lets `DB` tell the env when it starts or stops using its database directories . The `PosixFileSystem` takes this opportunity to set up a cache from database directories to the corresponding logical block sizes. 2. `LogicalBlockSizeCache` is defined only for OS_LINUX to cache the logical block sizes. Other modifications: 1. rename `logical buffer size` to `logical block size` to be consistent with Linux terms. 2. declare `GetLogicalBlockSize` in `PosixHelper` to expose it to `PosixFileSystem`. 3. change the functions `IOError` and `IOStatus` in `env/io_posix.h` to have external linkage since they are used in other translation units too.

In this case, previous RocksDB will just fail the recovery and return a non-ok status. This PR enables another possibility. During recovery, RocksDB checks possible MANIFEST files, and try to recover to the most recent state without missing table file. `VersionSet::Recover()` applies version edits incrementally and ""materializes"" a version only when this version does not reference any missing table file. After processing the entire MANIFEST, the version created last will be the latest version. `DBImpl::Recover()` calls `VersionSet::Recover()`. Afterwards, WAL replay will *not* be performed. To use this capability, set `options.best_efforts_recovery true` when opening the db. Best-efforts recovery is currently incompatible with atomic flush.

,,0.5985,rocksdb,"Attempt to recover from db with missing table files (#6334) Summary: There are situations when RocksDB tries to recover, but the db is in an inconsistent state due to SST files referenced in the MANIFEST being missing. In this case, previous RocksDB will just fail the recovery and return a non-ok status. This PR enables another possibility. During recovery, RocksDB checks possible MANIFEST files, and try to recover to the most recent state without missing table file. `VersionSet::Recover()` applies version edits incrementally and ""materializes"" a version only when this version does not reference any missing table file. After processing the entire MANIFEST, the version created last will be the latest version. `DBImpl::Recover()` calls `VersionSet::Recover()`. Afterwards, WAL replay will *not* be performed. To use this capability, set `options.best_efforts_recovery true` when opening the db. Best-efforts recovery is currently incompatible with atomic flush.

This slows down MyRocks recovery time when site is down. This PR introduces two new APIs: 1. `Env::RegisterDbPaths` and `Env::UnregisterDbPaths` lets `DB` tell the env when it starts or stops using its database directories . The `PosixFileSystem` takes this opportunity to set up a cache from database directories to the corresponding logical block sizes. 2. `LogicalBlockSizeCache` is defined only for OS_LINUX to cache the logical block sizes. Other modifications: 1. rename `logical buffer size` to `logical block size` to be consistent with Linux terms. 2. declare `GetLogicalBlockSize` in `PosixHelper` to expose it to `PosixFileSystem`. 3. change the functions `IOError` and `IOStatus` in `env/io_posix.h` to have external linkage since they are used in other translation units too. Pull Request resolved: Test Plan: 1. A new unit test is added for `LogicalBlockSizeCache` in `env/io_posix_test.cc`. 2.

This means that lost blob files cannot be detected at the moment. We plan to solve this issue by making blob files a part of `Version`; as a first step, this patch makes it possible to store information about blob files in `VersionEdit`. Currently, this information includes blob file number, total number and size of all blobs, and total number and size of garbage blobs. However, the format is extensible: new fields can be added in both a forward compatible and a forward incompatible manner if needed (similarly to `kNewFile4`).

,,0.5861,rocksdb,"Simplify migration to FileSystem API (#6552) Summary: The current Env/FileSystem API separation has a couple of issues 1. It requires the user to specify 2 options ```Options::env``` and ```Options::file_system``` which means they have to make code changes to benefit from the new APIs. Furthermore, there is a risk of accessing the same APIs in two different ways, through Env in the old way and through FileSystem in the new way. The two may not always match, for example, if env is ```PosixEnv``` and FileSystem is a custom implementation. Any stray RocksDB calls to env will use the ```PosixEnv``` implementation rather than the file_system implementation. 2. There needs to be a simple way for the FileSystem developer to instantiate an Env for backward compatibility purposes. This PR solves the above issues and simplifies the migration in the following ways 1. Embed a shared_ptr to the ```FileSystem``` in the ```Env```, and remove ```Options::file_system``` as a configurable option. This way, no code changes will be required in application code to benefit from the new API. The default Env constructor uses a ```LegacyFileSystemWrapper``` as the embedded ```FileSystem```. 1a. This also makes it more robust by ensuring that even if RocksDB has some stray calls to Env APIs rather than FileSystem, they will go through the same object and thus there is no risk of getting out of sync. 2. Provide a ```NewCompositeEnv()``` API that can be used to construct a PosixEnv with a custom FileSystem implementation. This eliminates an indirection to call Env APIs, and relieves the FileSystem developer of the burden of having to implement wrappers for the Env APIs. 3.

This slows down MyRocks recovery time when site is down. This PR introduces two new APIs: 1. `Env::RegisterDbPaths` and `Env::UnregisterDbPaths` lets `DB` tell the env when it starts or stops using its database directories . The `PosixFileSystem` takes this opportunity to set up a cache from database directories to the corresponding logical block sizes. 2. `LogicalBlockSizeCache` is defined only for OS_LINUX to cache the logical block sizes. Other modifications: 1. rename `logical buffer size` to `logical block size` to be consistent with Linux terms. 2. declare `GetLogicalBlockSize` in `PosixHelper` to expose it to `PosixFileSystem`. 3. change the functions `IOError` and `IOStatus` in `env/io_posix.h` to have external linkage since they are used in other translation units too. Pull Request resolved: Test Plan: 1. A new unit test is added for `LogicalBlockSizeCache` in `env/io_posix_test.cc`. 2.

This means that lost blob files cannot be detected at the moment. We plan to solve this issue by making blob files a part of `Version`; as a first step, this patch makes it possible to store information about blob files in `VersionEdit`. Currently, this information includes blob file number, total number and size of all blobs, and total number and size of garbage blobs. However, the format is extensible: new fields can be added in both a forward compatible and a forward incompatible manner if needed (similarly to `kNewFile4`).

It requires the user to specify 2 options ```Options::env``` and ```Options::file_system``` which means they have to make code changes to benefit from the new APIs. Furthermore, there is a risk of accessing the same APIs in two different ways, through Env in the old way and through FileSystem in the new way. The two may not always match, for example, if env is ```PosixEnv``` and FileSystem is a custom implementation. Any stray RocksDB calls to env will use the ```PosixEnv``` implementation rather than the file_system implementation. 2. There needs to be a simple way for the FileSystem developer to instantiate an Env for backward compatibility purposes. This PR solves the above issues and simplifies the migration in the following ways 1. Embed a shared_ptr to the ```FileSystem``` in the ```Env```, and remove ```Options::file_system``` as a configurable option. This way, no code changes will be required in application code to benefit from the new API. The default Env constructor uses a ```LegacyFileSystemWrapper``` as the embedded ```FileSystem```. 1a. This also makes it more robust by ensuring that even if RocksDB has some stray calls to Env APIs rather than FileSystem, they will go through the same object and thus there is no risk of getting out of sync. 2.

This eliminates an indirection to call Env APIs, and relieves the FileSystem developer of the burden of having to implement wrappers for the Env APIs. 3.

In this case, previous RocksDB will just fail the recovery and return a non-ok status. This PR enables another possibility. During recovery, RocksDB checks possible MANIFEST files, and try to recover to the most recent state without missing table file. `VersionSet::Recover()` applies version edits incrementally and ""materializes"" a version only when this version does not reference any missing table file. After processing the entire MANIFEST, the version created last will be the latest version. `DBImpl::Recover()` calls `VersionSet::Recover()`. Afterwards, WAL replay will *not* be performed. To use this capability, set `options.best_efforts_recovery true` when opening the db. Best-efforts recovery is currently incompatible with atomic flush.

This is not sufficient. There are cases when the caller explicitly specifies that a new MANIFEST be created. For example, if user sets options.write_dbid_to_manifest true, and there are WAL files, then RocksDB will run into an issue during recovery. `DBImpl::Recover()` will call `LogAndApply()` to write dbid. At this point, the db being recovered creates a new MANIFEST, say, MANIFEST-000003. Since there are WALs, `DBImpl::RecoverLogFiles` will be called. Towards the end of this function, we call `LogAndApply(new_descriptor_log=true)`, which explicitly creates a new MANIFEST. However, the manifest_file_number is wrong before this fix. Consequently, RocksDB opens an existing, non-empty file for append, effectively truncating the file to zero. If a crash occurs, then there will be data loss.

The `PosixFileSystem` takes this opportunity to set up a cache from database directories to the corresponding logical block sizes. 2. `LogicalBlockSizeCache` is defined only for OS_LINUX to cache the logical block sizes. Other modifications: 1. rename `logical buffer size` to `logical block size` to be consistent with Linux terms. 2. declare `GetLogicalBlockSize` in `PosixHelper` to expose it to `PosixFileSystem`. 3. change the functions `IOError` and `IOStatus` in `env/io_posix.h` to have external linkage since they are used in other translation units too. Pull Request resolved: Test Plan: 1. A new unit test is added for `LogicalBlockSizeCache` in `env/io_posix_test.cc`. 2. A new integration test is added for `DB` operations related to the cache in `db/db_logical_block_size_cache_test.cc`. `make check` Differential Revision: D20131243 Pulled By: cheng-chang fbshipit-source-id: 3077c50f8065c0bffb544d8f49fb10bba9408d04/Fix data race of GetCreationTimeOfOldestFile() (#6473) Summary: When DBImpl::GetCreationTimeOfOldestFile() calls Version::GetCreationTimeOfOldestFile(), the version is not directly or indirectly referenced, so an event like compaction can race with the operation and cause DBImpl::GetCreationTimeOfOldestFile() to access delocated data.

It requires the user to specify 2 options ```Options::env``` and ```Options::file_system``` which means they have to make code changes to benefit from the new APIs. Furthermore, there is a risk of accessing the same APIs in two different ways, through Env in the old way and through FileSystem in the new way. The two may not always match, for example, if env is ```PosixEnv``` and FileSystem is a custom implementation. Any stray RocksDB calls to env will use the ```PosixEnv``` implementation rather than the file_system implementation. 2. There needs to be a simple way for the FileSystem developer to instantiate an Env for backward compatibility purposes. This PR solves the above issues and simplifies the migration in the following ways 1. Embed a shared_ptr to the ```FileSystem``` in the ```Env```, and remove ```Options::file_system``` as a configurable option. This way, no code changes will be required in application code to benefit from the new API. The default Env constructor uses a ```LegacyFileSystemWrapper``` as the embedded ```FileSystem```. 1a. This also makes it more robust by ensuring that even if RocksDB has some stray calls to Env APIs rather than FileSystem, they will go through the same object and thus there is no risk of getting out of sync. 2. Provide a ```NewCompositeEnv()``` API that can be used to construct a PosixEnv with a custom FileSystem implementation. This eliminates an indirection to call Env APIs, and relieves the FileSystem developer of the burden of having to implement wrappers for the Env APIs. 3. Add a couple of missing FileSystem APIs ```SanitizeEnvOptions()``` and ```NewLogger()``` Tests: 1.

This slows down MyRocks recovery time when site is down. This PR introduces two new APIs: 1. `Env::RegisterDbPaths` and `Env::UnregisterDbPaths` lets `DB` tell the env when it starts or stops using its database directories . The `PosixFileSystem` takes this opportunity to set up a cache from database directories to the corresponding logical block sizes. 2. `LogicalBlockSizeCache` is defined only for OS_LINUX to cache the logical block sizes. Other modifications: 1. rename `logical buffer size` to `logical block size` to be consistent with Linux terms. 2. declare `GetLogicalBlockSize` in `PosixHelper` to expose it to `PosixFileSystem`. 3. change the functions `IOError` and `IOStatus` in `env/io_posix.h` to have external linkage since they are used in other translation units too. Pull Request resolved: Test Plan: 1. A new unit test is added for `LogicalBlockSizeCache` in `env/io_posix_test.cc`. 2. A new integration test is added for `DB` operations related to the cache in `db/db_logical_block_size_cache_test.cc`. `make check` Differential Revision: D20131243 Pulled By: cheng-chang fbshipit-source-id: 3077c50f8065c0bffb544d8f49fb10bba9408d04/Replace namespace name ""rocksdb"" with ROCKSDB_NAMESPACE (#6433) Summary: When dynamically linking two binaries together, different builds of RocksDB from two sources might cause errors.

Since `ReuseWritableFile()` occurs outside the DB mutex, it was possible for a concurrent full purge to sneak in and delete the file before it could be renamed. Consequently, `SwitchMemtable()` would fail and the DB would enter read-only mode. The fix is to hold the old file number in `log_recycle_files_` until after the file has been renamed. Full purge uses that list to decide which files to keep, so it can no longer delete a file pending recycling.

,,0.4695,rocksdb,"Use function objects as deleters in the block cache (#6545) Summary: As the first step of reintroducing eviction statistics for the block cache, the patch switches from using simple function pointers as deleters to function objects implementing an interface. This will enable using deleters that have state, like a smart pointer to the statistics object that is to be updated when an entry is removed from the cache. For now, the patch adds a deleter template class `SimpleDeleter`, which simply casts the `value` pointer to its original type and calls `delete` or `delete[]` on it as appropriate. Note: to prevent object lifecycle issues, deleters must outlive the cache entries referring to them; `SimpleDeleter` ensures this by using the (""leaky"") Meyers singleton pattern.

It requires the user to specify 2 options ```Options::env``` and ```Options::file_system``` which means they have to make code changes to benefit from the new APIs. Furthermore, there is a risk of accessing the same APIs in two different ways, through Env in the old way and through FileSystem in the new way. The two may not always match, for example, if env is ```PosixEnv``` and FileSystem is a custom implementation. Any stray RocksDB calls to env will use the ```PosixEnv``` implementation rather than the file_system implementation. 2. There needs to be a simple way for the FileSystem developer to instantiate an Env for backward compatibility purposes. This PR solves the above issues and simplifies the migration in the following ways 1. Embed a shared_ptr to the ```FileSystem``` in the ```Env```, and remove ```Options::file_system``` as a configurable option. This way, no code changes will be required in application code to benefit from the new API. The default Env constructor uses a ```LegacyFileSystemWrapper``` as the embedded ```FileSystem```. 1a. This also makes it more robust by ensuring that even if RocksDB has some stray calls to Env APIs rather than FileSystem, they will go through the same object and thus there is no risk of getting out of sync. 2. Provide a ```NewCompositeEnv()``` API that can be used to construct a PosixEnv with a custom FileSystem implementation. This eliminates an indirection to call Env APIs, and relieves the FileSystem developer of the burden of having to implement wrappers for the Env APIs. 3.

,,0.2071,rocksdb,"Add blob file state to VersionEdit (#6416) Summary: BlobDB currently does not keep track of blob files: no records are written to the manifest when a blob file is added or removed, and upon opening a database, the list of blob files is populated simply based on the contents of the blob directory. This means that lost blob files cannot be detected at the moment. We plan to solve this issue by making blob files a part of `Version`; as a first step, this patch makes it possible to store information about blob files in `VersionEdit`. Currently, this information includes blob file number, total number and size of all blobs, and total number and size of garbage blobs. However, the format is extensible: new fields can be added in both a forward compatible and a forward incompatible manner if needed (similarly to `kNewFile4`).

,,0.1483,rocksdb,"Fix flaky test DecreaseNumBgThreads (#6393) Summary: The DecreaseNumBgThreads test keeps failing on Windows in AppVeyor. It fails because it depends on a timed wait for the tasks to be dequeued from the threadpools internal queue, but within the specified time, the task might have not been scheduled onto the newly created threads. tries to fix this by waiting for longer time to let the threads scheduled. This PR tries to fix this by replacing the timed wait with a synchronization on the tasks internal conditional variable. When the number of threads increases, instead of guessing the time needed for the task to be scheduled, it directly blocks on the conditional variable until the task starts running. But when thread number is reduced, it still does a timed wait, but this does not lead to the flakiness now, will try to remove these timed waits in a future PR.

In direct IO mode, read requests are aligned and merged together before being issued to RandomAccessFile::MultiRead, so blocks in the original requests might share the same underlying buffer, the shared buffers are returned in `aligned_bufs`, which is a new parameter of the `MultiRead` API. For example, suppose alignment requirement for direct IO is 4KB, one request is (offset: 1KB, len: 1KB), another request is (offset: 3KB, len: 1KB), then since they all belong to page (offset: 0, len: 4KB), `MultiRead` only reads the page with direct IO into a buffer on heap, and returns 2 Slices referencing regions in that same buffer.
