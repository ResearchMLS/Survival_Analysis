comes back in hashed order, the resulting seek time is atrocious, and on a
large enough jar, the oh-so-reliable ZipFile would eventually just barf.  Now
we open the file twice, the second time as a ZipInputStream.  It's more
reliable and faster, though it does introduce assumptions about the file being
a regular file, still there when we try to open it the second time, etc.

before calling into the backend to avoid stack depth limit exceeded
errors.  Previously this was done only on query execution, but we
need to do it on iteration of the ResultSet as well.

In general it seems that anything operating inside of
synchronized(Backend.THREADLOCK) might need to adjust the stack
unless it's certain the work it's doing is trivial and won't invoke
check_stack_depth.  Unfortunately I don't know enough about when pg

In general it seems that anything operating inside of
synchronized(Backend.THREADLOCK) might need to adjust the stack
unless it's certain the work it's doing is trivial and won't invoke
check_stack_depth.  Unfortunately I don't know enough about when pg
calls check_stack_depth to know offhand what is/is not safe.  A more
thorough audit is required here.

That way, a snippet that will test some condition and enable that
implementor-name at install time can be declared to provide it, and
be emitted earlier. However, not to insist on supplying a snippet
that explicitly provides every implementor name ... some could just
be selected by the user with SET LOCAL pljava.implementors TO ...
before installing. So the implicit requirement will be counted in
indegree initially, to delay such a snippet as far as practical, but
only until a cycle-breaker releases it when no other progress can
be made./SQL generator now reports require cycles usefully.

Should have done that all along./Now Snippet can carry implementor-name.

Nothing sets it yet, but it now defaults to PostgreSQL for everything, in
recognition of the fact that hardly any of the PG SQL code that gets
generated here will be in the exact ISO-prescribed syntax of the exact
five allowed, unadorned SQL statements.

Yes, that makes DDR files bigger. The zip format will compress them well./Workaround the problem reported in #39.

The annotation processor in javac runs in multiple 'rounds', as long as
generated source files keep appearing, and one final round after they
don't. This code used to save some mapping of Class objects to the
javax.lang.model objects (TypeElement/TypeMirror) until the final round,
which worked in Java 6, but as of 7 one gets back different model objects
in different rounds, for the same types, and they don't match, so type
mapping breaks.

This workaround moves all those lookups to before or during round 1, when
a consistent set of model objects can be looked up. So, it will work as
long as all the source files that might contain pljava annotations will be
found in round 1. That should always be the case unless someone is using a
very fancy build with _other_ annotation processors generating new source
files with pljava annotations that have to be processed in additional
rounds. For now, that won't work, because their types won't seem to match
what was computed in round 1. So don't do that.

Run deployment descriptors in correct order./Run deployment descriptors in correct order.

Previously determined the order of multiple deployment descriptors in
a single jar according to the order of those entries as stored in the jar
(used in that order for install, and that order reversed for remove).

But that wasn't correct. I got my hands on 2003 and 2006 drafts of the
SQL/JRT spec and they both clearly say it is the order _as the entries
are listed in the manifest_ that matters (again, in that order for install,
and the reverse for remove).

This should be a welcome improvement, because I had noted back in
commit 0edc9e5f that maven doesn't always put things in a jar in
the same order, and that was causing the pljava-examples jar to be
broken about half the time (for autodeployment anyway). But the manifest
is a static file listing the ddrs in the right order, so as long as
maven doesn't reorder it while putting it in the jar, that behavior
should now be stable./",nan,"Thomas Hallgren/thomas@tada.se, Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-01-20 19:52:11+00:00,src/java/pljava/org/postgresql/pljava/internal/Backend.java,pljava/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/internal/Backend.java,/2004-08-17 08:51:01+00:00/2013-01-13 16:59:58-08:00,nan,nan,2015-07-14T05:59:00Z/2015-07-15T06:40:13Z/,added/renamed/renamed

Workaround #39 breakage seen with Java 7/Revert change made in bd6f79c because type mapping broke.

Issue #39 stopped the DDRProcessor from finding the correct return type
for this example function, so in bd6f79c and 7b5f28d an explicit type
annotation was added. DDRProcessor finds the right type again, so
reverting the explicit annotation (which only served to mask a problem)./",nan,"Thomas Hallgren/thomas@tada.se, Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2005-01-23 10:56:36+00:00,src/java5/examples/org/postgresql/pljava/example/annotation/UsingPropertiesAsScalarSet.java,pljava-examples/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/example/annotation/UsingPropertiesAsScalarSet.java,/2013-02-28 13:30:33-05:00,nan,nan,2015-07-15T06:38:48Z/2015-07-15T00:43:51Z/,added/renamed

nar-maven-plugin turns on such aggressive gcc warnings that it ends up
warning about a = b ? c : d where the things are all bool. Sure, strictly
by the standard, c and d get integer-promoted and then have to be
narrowed back to bool, but gcc would know better than to give a warning
if bool really were _Bool. The thing is, PostgreSQL's c.h is defining it
to be char, so gcc doesn't know better.

If it were happening a ton of places I would just live with it or turn off
the warning, but changing two places isn't so bad. Rewrote using 'if' to
look less dorky than hanging a (bool) cast on a perfectly obviously

nar-maven-plugin turns on such aggressive gcc warnings that it ends up
warning about a = b ? c : d where the things are all bool. Sure, strictly
by the standard, c and d get integer-promoted and then have to be
narrowed back to bool, but gcc would know better than to give a warning
if bool really were _Bool. The thing is, PostgreSQL's c.h is defining it
to be char, so gcc doesn't know better.

If it were happening a ton of places I would just live with it or turn off
the warning, but changing two places isn't so bad. Rewrote using 'if' to
look less dorky than hanging a (bool) cast on a perfectly obviously
boolean expression./Zap a few more conversion (not sign-) warnings.

have a good ""average text"" corpus to test on; the test case for this

Spotted among the flurry of gcc warnings, most of which were nuisances.

Declaring `dataLen` as `int16` makes sense if looking at the `typlen`
catalog attribute, but then in `coerceScalarDatum` it can later get used
for a `varlena` size, which can be up to 1GB-ish.

It wasn't strictly necessary to change it also in `coerceScalarObject`
(`buffer.len` gets used for the var size there), but I did for consistency.
Other `dataLen`s later in the file were already `int32`, so now they all
are.

I was baffled why `tm_gmtoff` would ever be declared `long` until I saw
Tom Lane's comment [just this last May][revelation]: ""The fact that
`tm_gmtoff` is declared as `long` is no doubt a hangover from days when
`int` might be only 16 bits ....""  I'm not sure 'hangover' is the word
he meant but it seems strangely appropriate.

His solution was to cast to `int` without compunction, and so is mine.
There's even the luxury of saying `int32` and never again worrying about
whether it's big enough for ±86400 seconds.

The rest of ""Bugfix 1011181""/The rest of ""Bugfix 1011181""

This was one problem being solved two ways. First there was code
to double any percent signs in a string that would be passed to elog.
But then myrkraverk in 2012 (622d0ac) got a compiler warning about
using a non-constant format string, and changed the elog call to
pass the supplied string as an argument to `%s` format, which is the
cleaner solution anyway, but didn't remove the old code, so `%` signs
were printing out doubled./","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, Kenneth Olson/pega_olsok@yahoo.com, ","Thomas Hallgren/thomas@tada.se, Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, Kenneth Olson/pega_olsok@yahoo.com, ",2004-01-07 11:10:33+00:00,src/C/pljava/Backend.c,pljava-so/src/main/c/Backend.c,/2004-01-16 17:33:46+00:00/2004-01-20 19:52:11+00:00/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,nan,2014-07-05T17:02:16Z/2015-09-17T05:38:49Z/2015-10-03T17:15:22Z/,2015-07-21T06:55:27Z/2015-07-21T02:43:38Z/2014-07-05T17:02:16Z/2015-09-17T05:38:49Z/2015-08-17T21:48:03Z/2015-10-03T17:15:22Z/,added/renamed/renamed/renamed

Completes the work on MappedUDT, with Point and ComplexTuple now
annotation examples, and the corresponding code removed from the
old hand-maintained examples.ddr.

In a couple last this-really-has-to-be-it review passes...

- some msg() calls had the Element parameter in the wrong place (and,
  being variadic and expecting extra parameters, didn't warn about it).
- whether to include length/alignment/storage in the output when 'like'
  is used should explicitly depend on whether they were set explicitly
  (is that explicit enough?); otherwise, in some cases it wouldn't be
  possible to override the values copied by like.
- removed a goofy constant in the VarlenaUDTTest left over from very
  early sanity checking.
- Shortened unnecessary full-qualification on some enums actually in
  scope./Conform to BaseUDT rename, add MappedUDT.

Supporting MappedUDT is much simpler. It emits a
CREATE TYPE foo AS ( ... structure ... )
if a structure is provided, or not, if it isn't, followed by a
SELECT sqlj.add_type_mapping( ... ), and that's it.

Much javadoc also added.

Earlier in the week I saw truly perplexing errors that stemmed
from a simple missing or misspelled import, but javac, instead
of reporting the error, would supply DDRProcessor with an instance
of an internal Error class where the unresolvable value should have
been. So now, at least recognize that Error class and produce a more
helpful message. Now, of course, I am unable to test the change,
because javac (same version! same machine!) is now doing the right
thing every time. At least with this change, if the right conditions
are ever hit again for javac to misbehave as it was earlier, the
message should be more helpful./Conform to BaseUDT rename, add MappedUDT.

The language handler functions are created with CREATE OR REPLACE
so they will be sure to refer to the newly-specified native library,
without requiring a cascading drop of everything depending on them.

Most of what belongs in the schema can be autogenerated into a
pljava.ddr by annotations in Commands.java. No Deployer or install.sql
to keep in sync. (For some reason the byte[] parameters had to be
explicitly SQLType'd bytea, even though the DDRProcessor type mapper
is supposed to know that. A puzzle for another day.)/","Workaround Windows creating_extension visibility.

Should now detect (in most cases?) when an extension is
being created, even in versions where creating_extension
isn't visible in Windows. Test depends on seeing the command
in ActivePortal; I am not sure what contexts could be contrived
where that wouldn't work right, but ordinary foreseeable cases
seem to work.

Got rid of pljavaInExtension: the idea that two cases have to be
distinguished (loading PL/Java itself as an extension, or using it
in the creation of some other extension) was sound, but the second
case isn't something that can be checked once at load time; it needs
a backend function that sqlj.install_jar can invoke whenever needed./Don't fail in remove_jar if schema dropped.

The pljava-examples jar has long had an annoying behavior because
its remove actions drop its schema, and if deployRemove had changed
the schema's classpath to include the jar, it would fail upon trying
to restore the original classpath on the now-nonexistent schema.

Resolved by telling deployRemove it's ok for the classpath restoration
to fail if the reason is the schema's gone. All references to the removed
jar will be gone from classpath_entry anyway; referential integrity
sees to that./Part of issue #12, schema migration.

Add a naming system for schema variants that have existed
during PL/Java's VCS history. A quick check looks at the existing
tables, if any, to infer what schema is there.

This allows a second or subsequent LOAD to succeed without trying
to recreate tables, if a quick check suggests the existing tables
are as the code expects. If an earlier PL/Java schema is recognized,
and a recipe for migrating from it is available, the schema is
migrated. (Recommendation: do PL/Java upgrade in a transaction, so
schema changes can be rolled back if something is unsatisfactory.)

The two supplied recipes handle schemas as far back as 2006-02-26,
anyway./Merge pull request #75 from tada/chore/master/javadoc8

Supporting MappedUDT is much simpler. It emits a

SELECT sqlj.add_type_mapping( ... ), and that's it.

Much javadoc also added.

This commit ends with pure renames of the Point and ComplexTuple

compilation until they are fixed up in the next commit, but git can
see where they went./Add a class annotation to make a base/scalar UDT.

- Add the annotation, have DDRProcessor recognize it.
- Check the annotated class for the required properties and members.
- The snippets map formerly allowed only one type of annotation on
  a given element. That happened to work, but not now when a class
  could have both a UDT and a SQLAction annotation, for example.
  Adapt the map to key by element and snippet class, so snippets
  of different classes can be hung on an element and selectively
  retrieved.
- An old comment in populateAnnotationImpl suggested it would reduce
  boilerplate setter code if, failing to find a setter method, the
  field itself could be reflectively looked up and stored. That's done
  now, so setter methods are needed only when something more special
  has to be done.
- Function declarations will be synthesized automagically for the four
  mandatory (in, out, recv, send) methods, but to allow their properties
  to be individually adjusted, they can still accept Function
  annotations. That's done by hanging a new subclass of FunctionImpl on
  those elements, that generates the right special form of declaration,
  and has setters that refuse changes to certain properties where that
  wouldn't make sense.
- Treat the default implementor-tag (PostgreSQL if not changed with new
  ddr.implementor command line property) specially. Now that everything
  is getting wrapped with an implementor tag by default, the implied
  requires=""implementor-tag"" was holding everything back until released
  by the cycle-breaker, sometimes in puzzling order. The implementor tag
  that happens to be the default one should /not/ be treated as a
  pending requirement.
- Move ComplexScalar to annotation subpackage, in preparation for
  revamping it as an annotation example. So git won't lose track of it,
  this is a breaking change, to be fixed in the next commit with edits
  corresponding to the move./","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2006-02-12 18:46:04+00:00,pljava-examples/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/example/ComplexScalar.java,pljava-examples/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/example/annotation/ComplexScalar.java,/2006-05-06 11:41:13+00:00/2013-01-13 16:48:40-08:00/2015-10-08 20:58:49-04:00,nan,2015-10-18T04:53:34Z/2016-01-05T04:59:46Z/,2015-10-09T00:58:49Z/2015-10-18T18:26:40Z/,added/renamed/renamed/renamed

The long pgsql-hackers thread in 2014 discovering that MSVC could
silently link global variables to the wrong stuff if not properly
decorated in PG's .h files documents how the problem of silently
succeeding was solved by making such cases fail instead. That's
great, only now they fail.

These patches make the pessimistic assumption that no working way
to access the global variables will be found. That might not be the
case, because there's a recent new pgsql-hackers thread

http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAFj8pRAEj9vCj6kn0Vh7o1xRKty=zTmSSTrc1e2uSRMOq8cCVw@mail.gmail.com

that has rekindled some interest in finding a better solution to the
problem. Anyway, until that day, these workarounds should achieve the

Having committed to PG 8.2 as a minimum version, simplify all
PGSQL_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH}_VER compiler conditionals to use
PG_VERSION_NUM (which appeared in 8.2), and completely eliminate
the branches for PG < 8.2./Track PostgreSQL's changes to stack base access.

set_stack_base() and restore_stack_base() were added in preference to
direct access to stack_base_ptr (for 9.2, backpatched into 9.1.4,
9.0.8, 8.4.12, and 8.3.19). They require miscadmin.h to be included
in those source files that use the STACK_BASE_PUSH / STACK_BASE_POP
macros (there is so much in miscadmin.h, I did not want to add it in
pljava.h and have it processed everywhere).

Also added example ThreadTest.java just to exercise the new logic.
However, if enabled to run from the deployment descriptor, it does
deadlock; apparently PG -> J -> (otherthread PG) works, but the deeper
PG -> J -> PG -> J -> (otherthread PG) does not, and I *suspect* it's
because of the JNI warning against mispairing bytecode monitorenters with
JNI monitorexits. But that is what the code has done for years now, so
if nothing has been reported, there must not be high demand for that use
pattern./","Correct two converted conditions.

The long pgsql-hackers thread in 2014 discovering that MSVC could
silently link global variables to the wrong stuff if not properly
decorated in PG's .h files documents how the problem of silently
succeeding was solved by making such cases fail instead. That's
great, only now they fail.

These patches make the pessimistic assumption that no working way
to access the global variables will be found. That might not be the
case, because there's a recent new pgsql-hackers thread

http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAFj8pRAEj9vCj6kn0Vh7o1xRKty=zTmSSTrc1e2uSRMOq8cCVw@mail.gmail.com

Ok, this compiles and doesn't break any -examples tests (and will give
errors for unhandled return cases, or a warning when disregarding
domain constraints). The reason it went unnoticed so long is that
Type_getCoerce{In,Out} are really very seldom called. They are almost
dead code--fairly contrived function declarations are needed even to
force them to be called for test purposes.

That seems to be mostly because Type_getCoerce{In,Out} won't be
called if Type_canReplaceType returns true, which it very often does,
because (a) Type_fromOid silently replaces domains with their base
types, and (b) Function builds the method signature by mapping the
SQL return type to a Java type and looking for a matching method, failing
if none is found, rather than looking for a method by its name and
parameter signature only, then validating its return type. So, essentially
by construction, coercion of the return type can't ever turn out to be
necessary.

It could, however, if the AS string gives the Java return type explicitly,
and it requires coercion to the (base type of the) SQL type. SQL/JRT has
no syntax to specify the Java return type, but as an extension it seems
PL/Java does: ""Function mapping"" in the wiki gives an example where it
precedes class.method, separated by a space. Only the example doesn't
work. That's because the getAS code accepts the syntax only when the
return type is purely alphanumeric (no dots, so non-package-qualified).
Not a recent change, has been that way since 2006. An = is also accepted,
though, even after a package-qualified return type. The example works if
retried with an =.

SQL/JRT, it seems to me, specifies the other approach to method
resolution, that is, find the method by name and parameter signature,
then work out what to do with its return type, but that would be a change
to current PL/Java behavior.

The unimplemented warning for RELABELTYPE to a domain type essentially
can't be triggered, because of the way any domain is replaced by its base
type before consulting canReplaceType. That's harmless for IN parameters.
For the return type, it's a type-safety hole: a PL/Java function can
return a value that isn't valid for its declared result domain. Fixing
that should be possible, but beyond the scope of this issue.

The not-implemented errors for COERCEVIAIO and ARRAYCOERCE can be
triggered, just by constructing exactly the sort of function declarations
where you would expect those things to happen. They would still be
arguably contrived cases, where the AS string specifies a method with
different types than would naturally correspond to the SQL ones.
Nevertheless, the ""Function mappping"" wiki page says ""PL/Java will use
a standard PostgreSQL explicit cast when the SQL type of the parameter
or return value does not correspond..."" and that's not completely true
at the moment, as long as some features available in standard PostgreSQL
explicit casts, like array or I/O coercion, aren't yet implemented.
Again, beyond the scope of issue 65. At least those cases now give clear
errors, instead of crashes or Krueger numbers as I just confirmed in a
build without this change, so this does in fact fix a latent bug.

Note that the single-row result set writers used for functions that
return composite or set-of-composite results have their own coercion
logic completely unrelated to this, and implemented in SPIConnection.java.
There are more moving parts here than I had hoped..../Type_getCoerceOut correct statement order.

Ken Olson pointed this out as a case of 'dead code', but in fact it was
live use of an unassigned variable just before the function call that
was going to assign it. Had to be an editing mixup, has been that way
a very long time, and has probably not caused more problems only because
it's statistically rare for a random stack location to be exactly equal
to InvalidOid.

Scratches the surface of #65. A full solution for that issue will have to
come later, but this much was an obvious Heisenbug with an obvious fix./","Use PG 8.3 find_coercion_pathway API.

SQL return type to a Java type and looking for a matching method, failing
if none is found, rather than looking for a method by its name and
parameter signature only, then validating its return type. So, essentially
by construction, coercion of the return type can't ever turn out to be
necessary.

It could, however, if the AS string gives the Java return type explicitly,
and it requires coercion to the (base type of the) SQL type. SQL/JRT has
no syntax to specify the Java return type, but as an extension it seems
PL/Java does: ""Function mapping"" in the wiki gives an example where it
precedes class.method, separated by a space. Only the example doesn't
work. That's because the getAS code accepts the syntax only when the
return type is purely alphanumeric (no dots, so non-package-qualified).
Not a recent change, has been that way since 2006. An = is also accepted,
though, even after a package-qualified return type. The example works if
retried with an =.

SQL/JRT, it seems to me, specifies the other approach to method
resolution, that is, find the method by name and parameter signature,
then work out what to do with its return type, but that would be a change
to current PL/Java behavior.

The unimplemented warning for RELABELTYPE to a domain type essentially
can't be triggered, because of the way any domain is replaced by its base
type before consulting canReplaceType. That's harmless for IN parameters.
For the return type, it's a type-safety hole: a PL/Java function can
return a value that isn't valid for its declared result domain. Fixing
that should be possible, but beyond the scope of this issue.

The not-implemented errors for COERCEVIAIO and ARRAYCOERCE can be
triggered, just by constructing exactly the sort of function declarations
where you would expect those things to happen. They would still be
arguably contrived cases, where the AS string specifies a method with
different types than would naturally correspond to the SQL ones.
Nevertheless, the ""Function mappping"" wiki page says ""PL/Java will use
a standard PostgreSQL explicit cast when the SQL type of the parameter
or return value does not correspond..."" and that's not completely true
at the moment, as long as some features available in standard PostgreSQL
explicit casts, like array or I/O coercion, aren't yet implemented.
Again, beyond the scope of issue 65. At least those cases now give clear
errors, instead of crashes or Krueger numbers as I just confirmed in a
build without this change, so this does in fact fix a latent bug.

Note that the single-row result set writers used for functions that
return composite or set-of-composite results have their own coercion
logic completely unrelated to this, and implemented in SPIConnection.java.
There are more moving parts here than I had hoped..../Merge pull request #66 from tada/bug/master/coerceout

Type_getCoerceOut correct statement order.

Calling this one obvious enough to be uncontroversial./Type_getCoerceOut correct statement order.

Ken Olson pointed this out as a case of 'dead code', but in fact it was
live use of an unassigned variable just before the function call that
was going to assign it. Had to be an editing mixup, has been that way
a very long time, and has probably not caused more problems only because
it's statistically rare for a random stack location to be exactly equal
to InvalidOid.

Scratches the surface of #65. A full solution for that issue will have to
come later, but this much was an obvious Heisenbug with an obvious fix./","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-01-07 11:10:33+00:00,src/C/pljava/type/Type.c,pljava-so/src/main/c/type/Type.c,/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,nan,2015-12-21T02:19:10Z/2015-11-13T04:01:33Z/,2015-12-21T02:19:10Z/2015-11-13T04:01:33Z/2015-11-13T04:06:37Z/,added/renamed

in ActivePortal; I am not sure what contexts could be contrived
where that wouldn't work right, but ordinary foreseeable cases
seem to work.

Got rid of pljavaInExtension: the idea that two cases have to be
distinguished (loading PL/Java itself as an extension, or using it
in the creation of some other extension) was sound, but the second

a backend function that sqlj.install_jar can invoke whenever needed./PL/Java as a PostgreSQL 9.1+ extension.

Because PL/Java installation is already touched off by a simple
library LOAD (even on pre-9.1 databases without the extension
framework), extension support is largely a matter of having
extension scripts that touch off a LOAD. But the library does need
to detect that case and change some behaviors slightly. When LOAD
is used directly and something fails because the settings aren't
right, Backend reports a WARNING rather than an ERROR, to make it
as easy as possible to keep explore settings and eventually get them
right, without forcing a rollback. However, under CREATE EXTENSION,
it must be reported as an error, or the extension machinery will
think all is well.

Also, playing with the settings after CREATE EXTENSION failed can
result in getting PL/Java successfully installed but not as an
extension--easily remedied with CREATE EXTENSION FROM UNPACKAGED,
so a NOTICE suggesting that is reported in that case.

The method of finding the module pathname from the LOAD argument
doesn't work under CREATE EXTENSION (ActivePortal still refers to
the CREATE EXTENSION command itself, not the LOAD command in the
script), so as a workaround the script creates a temporary table
with the module pathname in it. This turns out to be useful anyway,
because it allows distinguishing the case of PL/Java itself being
installed by CREATE EXTENSION from the case where PL/Java is already
installed and its library is getting loaded in passing during
CREATE EXTENSION for something that depends on it. (Actual support
for PL/Java-managed extensions will have to come later, but the
case needs to be recognized even to say ""you can't do that yet."")

Not a full implementation of type modifiers (which were requested
in feature request 1011140), which would be too much to hold 1.5.0 for,
but just enough to avoid releasing a version that gets in the way later:
the SQL generator had better at least emit the three-argument forms for
input and receive function declarations, or they would later have to be
dropped and replaced, a cascading disruption. Non-default values in the
extra arguments are not yet supported; they'll just cause unsupported
feature ereports.

As it turns out, only rare corners of PostgreSQL need that support;
most application of typmods is done with the three-argument cast, which
is already expressible in PL/Java. So, unexpectedly, mostly-usable
typmod support is already here, and a new example illustrates it./Lay groundwork for typmod support.

When the compiler hasn't made sense of an annotated element because
of some error in the source, it may pass the annotation processor an

to be to silently return (before anything that risks a class cast
exception), as the compiler will produce its own messages about what
the true problem was./Call getSQLType earlier for errors' sake.

Unmappable types can be discovered when building the deployStrings
for a function, which normally happens too late for good error
messages if javac throws stuff away between rounds. So, just make
the messages, if any, happen early, by having FunctionImpl call its
deployStrings from characterize./Invoke characterize methods earlier.

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Clunky but serviceable way to set byte order.

Addresses issue #98. There really hasn't been a document that just lays
out in detail how PL/Java's data coercions are chosen and especially how
the raw-chunk-based versions of SQLInput/SQLOutput work. Discovered,
while documenting that, the reason Point was showing bogus values (noted
in pull request #59 comments) ... byte order ... leading to a
last-minute rework of SQLInputFromChunk and SQLOutputToChunk allowing
byte order to be selected.

(It has to be selectable, not just fixed, in case PL/Java gets updated
at a site that has a bunch of data stored under the old byte order.
A switch allows dumping with the old order, then reloading with the
new. In fact, by choosing a different byte order for each conversion
direction, it is possible ... carefully ... to update in place.)

A flag is passed to SQLInputFromChunk_create and
SQLOutputFromChunk_create to indicate whether the type is
a 'java-based scalar' (otherwise, it is a non-composite mirror),
and this allows byte order to be specified separately for scalars
and mirrors: historically, it was always bigendian regardless of
architecture. Presumably that has never mattered much for java-based
scalars (because PostgreSQL itself doesn't have any independent way
of seeing into them, so no inconsistency was visible), but for a
mirror type it is definitely broken if the hardware is not bigendian,
with PostgreSQL and Java not seeing the values the same way.

Therefore, this change leaves the scalar default (for 1.5.0 at least)
at bigendian, in case some sites may have used Java-based scalars in
the past and have tables that contain them. Also, the current UDT
implementation gives every scalar type a binary send/receive/COPY
format that can't (yet) be decoupled from its internal stored form, and
the PostgreSQL docs specify big-endian for those binary transfer formats,
so it would be premature to change the scalar byte-order default before
it is also possible to have a separate transfer format.

For mirror types, on the other hand, the default is here immediately
changed to native ... it is less likely that sites were heavily
using mirror UDTs if they were seeing bogus values, and this will
make them work right by default.

Java properties are used (set with -D in the pljava.vmoptions GUC):
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder  to set everything the same,

org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror  to set them separately.

The allowable values for each property are big_endian, little_endian,
and native.

Even finer-grained control is available with:
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.j2p
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.j2p

for a very special purpose, should someone wish to attempt an
UPDATE where within a session, a column with values written
in one order gets rewritten in another, a fiddly and somewhat
unnerving process that turns out to actually work, and has a
full new page documenting it now./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-01-20 19:52:11+00:00,src/java/pljava/org/postgresql/pljava/internal/Backend.java,pljava/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/internal/Backend.java,/2004-08-17 08:51:01+00:00/2013-01-13 16:59:58-08:00,nan,nan,2016-03-19T02:22:17Z/2016-03-19T02:16:55Z/,added/renamed/renamed

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Clunky but serviceable way to set byte order.

Addresses issue #98. There really hasn't been a document that just lays
out in detail how PL/Java's data coercions are chosen and especially how
the raw-chunk-based versions of SQLInput/SQLOutput work. Discovered,
while documenting that, the reason Point was showing bogus values (noted
in pull request #59 comments) ... byte order ... leading to a
last-minute rework of SQLInputFromChunk and SQLOutputToChunk allowing
byte order to be selected.

(It has to be selectable, not just fixed, in case PL/Java gets updated
at a site that has a bunch of data stored under the old byte order.
A switch allows dumping with the old order, then reloading with the
new. In fact, by choosing a different byte order for each conversion
direction, it is possible ... carefully ... to update in place.)

A flag is passed to SQLInputFromChunk_create and
SQLOutputFromChunk_create to indicate whether the type is
a 'java-based scalar' (otherwise, it is a non-composite mirror),
and this allows byte order to be specified separately for scalars
and mirrors: historically, it was always bigendian regardless of
architecture. Presumably that has never mattered much for java-based
scalars (because PostgreSQL itself doesn't have any independent way
of seeing into them, so no inconsistency was visible), but for a
mirror type it is definitely broken if the hardware is not bigendian,
with PostgreSQL and Java not seeing the values the same way.

Therefore, this change leaves the scalar default (for 1.5.0 at least)
at bigendian, in case some sites may have used Java-based scalars in
the past and have tables that contain them. Also, the current UDT
implementation gives every scalar type a binary send/receive/COPY
format that can't (yet) be decoupled from its internal stored form, and
the PostgreSQL docs specify big-endian for those binary transfer formats,
so it would be premature to change the scalar byte-order default before
it is also possible to have a separate transfer format.

For mirror types, on the other hand, the default is here immediately
changed to native ... it is less likely that sites were heavily
using mirror UDTs if they were seeing bogus values, and this will
make them work right by default.

Java properties are used (set with -D in the pljava.vmoptions GUC):
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder  to set everything the same,

org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror  to set them separately.

The allowable values for each property are big_endian, little_endian,
and native.

Even finer-grained control is available with:
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.j2p
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.j2p

for a very special purpose, should someone wish to attempt an
UPDATE where within a session, a column with values written
in one order gets rewritten in another, a fiddly and somewhat
unnerving process that turns out to actually work, and has a
full new page documenting it now./Rework extension wrappers slightly.

Ok, it seems that another change to the PostgreSQL large object APIs
happened in PG 9.0: large objects got ACLs. Before that, anybody could
access them. In PL/Java, anybody still can. :(

The ideal accommodation on PL/Java's side will be to retarget PL/Java's
LargeObject code from the PG inv_api.c layer to the be-fsstubs.c layer
(if something doesn't make that prohibitively difficult), because that's
where the 9.0+ access checks happen. Otherwise, the checking code needs
to be duplicated in PL/Java.

The fsstubs layer has only-good-within-one-transaction semantics.
Happily, that's all that's expected for the JDBC *LOB interfaces,
which presumably are the public API this stuff should ultimately have.

Too involved for 1.5.0. However, this is a good argument for a least-
privilege, no-public-by-default installation of the 'java' language,
documenting how GRANT USAGE can then be used to allow specific
users/roles to make PL/Java functions.

Moral: this wasn't a problem before 9.0, when everybody knew LOBs had
no access controls. It became a problem when PG added access controls
for them, and PL/Java didn't follow suit. What's a trusted language
today could need adjustments tomorrow, so no-public-usage-by-default
really seems like the best posture; the user/installer should always be
encouraged to follow the least privilege principle./","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2015-12-14 21:42:18-05:00,nan,nan,nan,nan,2016-03-27T23:28:33Z/2016-02-16T03:46:02Z/,2016-04-01T03:05:38Z/2016-03-27T23:28:33Z/2016-01-24T03:54:18Z/2016-02-16T03:46:02Z/2016-03-29T16:25:21Z/2016-04-01T01:26:48Z/2016-03-19T02:22:17Z/2016-03-19T02:16:55Z/,added

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Clunky but serviceable way to set byte order.

Addresses issue #98. There really hasn't been a document that just lays
out in detail how PL/Java's data coercions are chosen and especially how
the raw-chunk-based versions of SQLInput/SQLOutput work. Discovered,
while documenting that, the reason Point was showing bogus values (noted
in pull request #59 comments) ... byte order ... leading to a
last-minute rework of SQLInputFromChunk and SQLOutputToChunk allowing
byte order to be selected.

(It has to be selectable, not just fixed, in case PL/Java gets updated
at a site that has a bunch of data stored under the old byte order.
A switch allows dumping with the old order, then reloading with the
new. In fact, by choosing a different byte order for each conversion
direction, it is possible ... carefully ... to update in place.)

A flag is passed to SQLInputFromChunk_create and
SQLOutputFromChunk_create to indicate whether the type is
a 'java-based scalar' (otherwise, it is a non-composite mirror),
and this allows byte order to be specified separately for scalars
and mirrors: historically, it was always bigendian regardless of
architecture. Presumably that has never mattered much for java-based
scalars (because PostgreSQL itself doesn't have any independent way
of seeing into them, so no inconsistency was visible), but for a
mirror type it is definitely broken if the hardware is not bigendian,
with PostgreSQL and Java not seeing the values the same way.

Therefore, this change leaves the scalar default (for 1.5.0 at least)
at bigendian, in case some sites may have used Java-based scalars in
the past and have tables that contain them. Also, the current UDT
implementation gives every scalar type a binary send/receive/COPY
format that can't (yet) be decoupled from its internal stored form, and
the PostgreSQL docs specify big-endian for those binary transfer formats,
so it would be premature to change the scalar byte-order default before
it is also possible to have a separate transfer format.

For mirror types, on the other hand, the default is here immediately
changed to native ... it is less likely that sites were heavily
using mirror UDTs if they were seeing bogus values, and this will
make them work right by default.

Java properties are used (set with -D in the pljava.vmoptions GUC):
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder  to set everything the same,

org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror  to set them separately.

The allowable values for each property are big_endian, little_endian,
and native.

Even finer-grained control is available with:
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.j2p
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.j2p

for a very special purpose, should someone wish to attempt an
UPDATE where within a session, a column with values written

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Clunky but serviceable way to set byte order.

Addresses issue #98. There really hasn't been a document that just lays
out in detail how PL/Java's data coercions are chosen and especially how
the raw-chunk-based versions of SQLInput/SQLOutput work. Discovered,
while documenting that, the reason Point was showing bogus values (noted
in pull request #59 comments) ... byte order ... leading to a
last-minute rework of SQLInputFromChunk and SQLOutputToChunk allowing
byte order to be selected.

(It has to be selectable, not just fixed, in case PL/Java gets updated
at a site that has a bunch of data stored under the old byte order.
A switch allows dumping with the old order, then reloading with the
new. In fact, by choosing a different byte order for each conversion
direction, it is possible ... carefully ... to update in place.)

A flag is passed to SQLInputFromChunk_create and
SQLOutputFromChunk_create to indicate whether the type is
a 'java-based scalar' (otherwise, it is a non-composite mirror),
and this allows byte order to be specified separately for scalars
and mirrors: historically, it was always bigendian regardless of
architecture. Presumably that has never mattered much for java-based
scalars (because PostgreSQL itself doesn't have any independent way
of seeing into them, so no inconsistency was visible), but for a
mirror type it is definitely broken if the hardware is not bigendian,
with PostgreSQL and Java not seeing the values the same way.

Therefore, this change leaves the scalar default (for 1.5.0 at least)
at bigendian, in case some sites may have used Java-based scalars in
the past and have tables that contain them. Also, the current UDT
implementation gives every scalar type a binary send/receive/COPY
format that can't (yet) be decoupled from its internal stored form, and
the PostgreSQL docs specify big-endian for those binary transfer formats,
so it would be premature to change the scalar byte-order default before
it is also possible to have a separate transfer format.

For mirror types, on the other hand, the default is here immediately
changed to native ... it is less likely that sites were heavily
using mirror UDTs if they were seeing bogus values, and this will
make them work right by default.

Java properties are used (set with -D in the pljava.vmoptions GUC):
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder  to set everything the same,

org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror  to set them separately.

The allowable values for each property are big_endian, little_endian,
and native.

Even finer-grained control is available with:
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.j2p
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.j2p

for a very special purpose, should someone wish to attempt an
UPDATE where within a session, a column with values written
in one order gets rewritten in another, a fiddly and somewhat
unnerving process that turns out to actually work, and has a
full new page documenting it now./","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2006-02-12 18:46:04+00:00,src/java/pljava/org/postgresql/pljava/jdbc/SQLOutputToChunk.java,pljava/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/jdbc/SQLOutputToChunk.java,/2013-01-13 16:59:58-08:00,nan,2016-03-06T04:14:50Z/,2016-04-01T03:05:38Z/2016-04-01T01:26:48Z/2016-03-19T02:22:17Z/2016-03-19T02:16:55Z/,added/renamed

Windows sets int = long = int32, int64 = ""long long"". jni_md.h
on Windows defines jint as long, jlong as long long. The gcc
printf format checker in mingw notices these things. To keep it
quiet, cast to known types and use corresponding formats.

The debug messages are elogs, not ereports, hence not candidates for

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Clunky but serviceable way to set byte order.

Addresses issue #98. There really hasn't been a document that just lays
out in detail how PL/Java's data coercions are chosen and especially how
the raw-chunk-based versions of SQLInput/SQLOutput work. Discovered,
while documenting that, the reason Point was showing bogus values (noted
in pull request #59 comments) ... byte order ... leading to a
last-minute rework of SQLInputFromChunk and SQLOutputToChunk allowing
byte order to be selected.

(It has to be selectable, not just fixed, in case PL/Java gets updated
at a site that has a bunch of data stored under the old byte order.
A switch allows dumping with the old order, then reloading with the
new. In fact, by choosing a different byte order for each conversion
direction, it is possible ... carefully ... to update in place.)

A flag is passed to SQLInputFromChunk_create and
SQLOutputFromChunk_create to indicate whether the type is
a 'java-based scalar' (otherwise, it is a non-composite mirror),
and this allows byte order to be specified separately for scalars
and mirrors: historically, it was always bigendian regardless of
architecture. Presumably that has never mattered much for java-based
scalars (because PostgreSQL itself doesn't have any independent way
of seeing into them, so no inconsistency was visible), but for a
mirror type it is definitely broken if the hardware is not bigendian,
with PostgreSQL and Java not seeing the values the same way.

Therefore, this change leaves the scalar default (for 1.5.0 at least)
at bigendian, in case some sites may have used Java-based scalars in
the past and have tables that contain them. Also, the current UDT
implementation gives every scalar type a binary send/receive/COPY
format that can't (yet) be decoupled from its internal stored form, and
the PostgreSQL docs specify big-endian for those binary transfer formats,
so it would be premature to change the scalar byte-order default before
it is also possible to have a separate transfer format.

For mirror types, on the other hand, the default is here immediately
changed to native ... it is less likely that sites were heavily
using mirror UDTs if they were seeing bogus values, and this will
make them work right by default.

Java properties are used (set with -D in the pljava.vmoptions GUC):
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder  to set everything the same,

org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror  to set them separately.

The allowable values for each property are big_endian, little_endian,
and native.

Even finer-grained control is available with:
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.j2p
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.j2p

for a very special purpose, should someone wish to attempt an
UPDATE where within a session, a column with values written
in one order gets rewritten in another, a fiddly and somewhat
unnerving process that turns out to actually work, and has a
full new page documenting it now./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2006-02-11 13:57:50+00:00,src/C/include/pljava/SQLOutputToChunk.h,pljava-so/src/main/include/pljava/SQLOutputToChunk.h,/2006-02-12 18:46:04+00:00/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,nan,nan,2016-03-19T02:22:17Z/2016-03-19T02:16:55Z/,added/renamed/renamed

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Check for base UDT if no other type mapping found.

Addresses issue #99. The strategy of registering base UDTs on the
first call to their input/output/send/recv functions breaks down if
the first reference in a session to such a type is one that doesn't
involve calling those functions (for example, an existing table has
a column of that type, and a query wants to pass it to a Java
function accepting that type; PostgreSQL has no reason to think it
should call an I/O function in that case).

This change adds one more step to the rules in Type_fromOid. If no
previous step succeeded, and just before punting to String, take a
close look at the type to see if it could be a Base UDT.

That's a tedious check that involves following the type's input/
output/receive/send Oids via prolang back to their language Oids, and
(one could stop here by assuming the language will always be named
'java' or 'javaU', but if not) from there to the language's call

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Check for base UDT if no other type mapping found.

Addresses issue #99. The strategy of registering base UDTs on the
first call to their input/output/send/recv functions breaks down if
the first reference in a session to such a type is one that doesn't
involve calling those functions (for example, an existing table has
a column of that type, and a query wants to pass it to a Java
function accepting that type; PostgreSQL has no reason to think it
should call an I/O function in that case).

This change adds one more step to the rules in Type_fromOid. If no
previous step succeeded, and just before punting to String, take a
close look at the type to see if it could be a Base UDT.

That's a tedious check that involves following the type's input/
output/receive/send Oids via prolang back to their language Oids, and
(one could stop here by assuming the language will always be named
'java' or 'javaU', but if not) from there to the language's call
handler C function and its dynamic library path, which should match
PL/Java's. A future optimization could cache language Oids that are
found to refer to PL/Java, but it might not be needed often enough

Eliminate TupleDesc reference leak warnings at uses of

leak warnings, and it runs without any now, so in it goes as a
regression test./Plug composite UDT TupleDesc leak.

In the composite case, UDT was keeping a reference to the type's
TupleDesc, causing PostgreSQL's reference counter to report a leak.
Not a growing, memory leak: only one TupleDesc for each type would
be kept. Of more concern would be how to invalidate it if the
underlying type is altered. More convincing to just grab it from the
type cache whenever needed. More at:

Eliminate TupleDesc reference leak warnings at uses of
composite UDTs; also commit a test class from an old pgFoundry
bug report 1010962 - different issue, but also TupleDesc reference
leak warnings, and it runs without any now, so in it goes as a
regression test./Plug composite UDT TupleDesc leak.

In the composite case, UDT was keeping a reference to the type's
TupleDesc, causing PostgreSQL's reference counter to report a leak.
Not a growing, memory leak: only one TupleDesc for each type would
be kept. Of more concern would be how to invalidate it if the
underlying type is altered. More convincing to just grab it from the
type cache whenever needed. More at:

http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/56DF8122.20607@anastigmatix.net/Merge branch 'feature/REL1_5_STABLE/typmodprep' into REL1_5_STABLE

Not a full implementation of type modifiers (which were requested
in feature request 1011140), which would be too much to hold 1.5.0 for,
but just enough to avoid releasing a version that gets in the way later:
the SQL generator had better at least emit the three-argument forms for
input and receive function declarations, or they would later have to be
dropped and replaced, a cascading disruption. Non-default values in the
extra arguments are not yet supported; they'll just cause unsupported
feature ereports.

As it turns out, only rare corners of PostgreSQL need that support;
most application of typmods is done with the three-argument cast, which
is already expressible in PL/Java. So, unexpectedly, mostly-usable
typmod support is already here, and a new example illustrates it./Merge branch 'bug/REL1_5_STABLE/udtarch' into REL1_5_STABLE

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Clunky but serviceable way to set byte order.

Addresses issue #98. There really hasn't been a document that just lays
out in detail how PL/Java's data coercions are chosen and especially how
the raw-chunk-based versions of SQLInput/SQLOutput work. Discovered,
while documenting that, the reason Point was showing bogus values (noted
in pull request #59 comments) ... byte order ... leading to a
last-minute rework of SQLInputFromChunk and SQLOutputToChunk allowing
byte order to be selected.

(It has to be selectable, not just fixed, in case PL/Java gets updated
at a site that has a bunch of data stored under the old byte order.
A switch allows dumping with the old order, then reloading with the
new. In fact, by choosing a different byte order for each conversion
direction, it is possible ... carefully ... to update in place.)

A flag is passed to SQLInputFromChunk_create and
SQLOutputFromChunk_create to indicate whether the type is
a 'java-based scalar' (otherwise, it is a non-composite mirror),
and this allows byte order to be specified separately for scalars
and mirrors: historically, it was always bigendian regardless of
architecture. Presumably that has never mattered much for java-based
scalars (because PostgreSQL itself doesn't have any independent way
of seeing into them, so no inconsistency was visible), but for a
mirror type it is definitely broken if the hardware is not bigendian,
with PostgreSQL and Java not seeing the values the same way.

Therefore, this change leaves the scalar default (for 1.5.0 at least)
at bigendian, in case some sites may have used Java-based scalars in
the past and have tables that contain them. Also, the current UDT
implementation gives every scalar type a binary send/receive/COPY
format that can't (yet) be decoupled from its internal stored form, and
the PostgreSQL docs specify big-endian for those binary transfer formats,
so it would be premature to change the scalar byte-order default before
it is also possible to have a separate transfer format.

For mirror types, on the other hand, the default is here immediately
changed to native ... it is less likely that sites were heavily
using mirror UDTs if they were seeing bogus values, and this will
make them work right by default.

Java properties are used (set with -D in the pljava.vmoptions GUC):
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder  to set everything the same,

org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror  to set them separately.

The allowable values for each property are big_endian, little_endian,
and native.

Even finer-grained control is available with:
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar.j2p
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.p2j
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror.j2p

for a very special purpose, should someone wish to attempt an
UPDATE where within a session, a column with values written
in one order gets rewritten in another, a fiddly and somewhat
unnerving process that turns out to actually work, and has a
full new page documenting it now./Lay groundwork for typmod support.

To fully support type modifiers, including the three-argument forms
of input/receive functions, will take more thought than 1.5.0 can wait
for. But to release 1.5.0 with the SQL generator emitting the
one-argument forms would invite headaches later, because CREATE OR
REPLACE FUNCTION can't change the parameter list, and DROP/reCREATE
would cause cascading disruption. So, make sure the generator already
emits the three-argument form, and just be sure to fail if a non-default
typmod is in fact passed, with more complete support to be added later.

By happy chance, it seems that PostgreSQL only very rarely passes non-
default typmods to the input/receive functions--possibly only during
COPY operations. (Those were the only way I was able to test this
change.)

In most other cases where a typmod is used, PostgreSQL relies on a
typmod application cast in a separate step, not on passing the typmod
to input/receive. PL/Java is already usable to implement typmodin,
typmodout, and cast functions, so in limited testing it seems possible
already to do types with typmods, maybe as long as COPY operations on
them are not needed. Therefore, add an example that illustrates it./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2006-02-11 13:57:50+00:00,src/C/pljava/type/UDT.c,pljava-so/src/main/c/type/UDT.c,/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,nan,nan,2016-03-20T02:48:03Z/2016-03-19T03:13:00Z/2016-03-20T03:10:56Z/2016-03-19T02:22:17Z/2016-03-19T02:16:55Z/2016-03-18T23:48:10Z/,added/renamed

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Check for base UDT if no other type mapping found.

Addresses issue #99. The strategy of registering base UDTs on the
first call to their input/output/send/recv functions breaks down if
the first reference in a session to such a type is one that doesn't
involve calling those functions (for example, an existing table has
a column of that type, and a query wants to pass it to a Java
function accepting that type; PostgreSQL has no reason to think it
should call an I/O function in that case).

This change adds one more step to the rules in Type_fromOid. If no
previous step succeeded, and just before punting to String, take a
close look at the type to see if it could be a Base UDT.

That's a tedious check that involves following the type's input/
output/receive/send Oids via prolang back to their language Oids, and
(one could stop here by assuming the language will always be named
'java' or 'javaU', but if not) from there to the language's call
handler C function and its dynamic library path, which should match
PL/Java's. A future optimization could cache language Oids that are
found to refer to PL/Java, but it might not be needed often enough
to matter./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-01-07 11:10:33+00:00,src/C/pljava/type/Type.c,pljava-so/src/main/c/type/Type.c,/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,nan,nan,2016-03-20T02:48:03Z/2016-03-10T05:15:27Z/2016-03-20T03:10:56Z/2016-03-19T02:22:17Z/,added/renamed

Make the cluster name easily available if it is set (to a
nonempty string, in PostgreSQL versions where it is available),
as a java system property and in the title visible to jps
and jvisualvm.

In passing, lose the default vmoption to lock out jvisualvm local
connections. Noah Misch persuades me that PostgreSQL itself doesn't
make special efforts to prevent things that already require access
as the postgres user on the server host, and it would be unpostgresy
to do so here. Instead, simply document how to disable attachment,

Clarifies init-sequence error hint about JVM library file name, which can be somewhat different between platforms./Merge branch 'bug/REL1_5_STABLE/udtarch' into REL1_5_STABLE

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Check for base UDT if no other type mapping found.

Addresses issue #99. The strategy of registering base UDTs on the
first call to their input/output/send/recv functions breaks down if
the first reference in a session to such a type is one that doesn't
involve calling those functions (for example, an existing table has
a column of that type, and a query wants to pass it to a Java
function accepting that type; PostgreSQL has no reason to think it
should call an I/O function in that case).

This change adds one more step to the rules in Type_fromOid. If no
previous step succeeded, and just before punting to String, take a
close look at the type to see if it could be a Base UDT.

That's a tedious check that involves following the type's input/
output/receive/send Oids via prolang back to their language Oids, and
(one could stop here by assuming the language will always be named
'java' or 'javaU', but if not) from there to the language's call
handler C function and its dynamic library path, which should match
PL/Java's. A future optimization could cache language Oids that are
found to refer to PL/Java, but it might not be needed often enough
to matter./Accommodate Windowsish printf format differences.

Windows sets int = long = int32, int64 = ""long long"". jni_md.h
on Windows defines jint as long, jlong as long long. The gcc
printf format checker in mingw notices these things. To keep it
quiet, cast to known types and use corresponding formats.

The debug messages are elogs, not ereports, hence not candidates for
localization, so the format macro can be used directly. If localization
were needed, the formats would need %s with the number-to-string
conversion done in a separate step./Merge pull request #89 from tada/chore/master/debuglevels

Addresses the user-defined type issues reported as #98 and #99./Clunky but serviceable way to set byte order.

Addresses issue #98. There really hasn't been a document that just lays
out in detail how PL/Java's data coercions are chosen and especially how
the raw-chunk-based versions of SQLInput/SQLOutput work. Discovered,
while documenting that, the reason Point was showing bogus values (noted
in pull request #59 comments) ... byte order ... leading to a
last-minute rework of SQLInputFromChunk and SQLOutputToChunk allowing
byte order to be selected.

(It has to be selectable, not just fixed, in case PL/Java gets updated
at a site that has a bunch of data stored under the old byte order.
A switch allows dumping with the old order, then reloading with the
new. In fact, by choosing a different byte order for each conversion
direction, it is possible ... carefully ... to update in place.)

A flag is passed to SQLInputFromChunk_create and
SQLOutputFromChunk_create to indicate whether the type is
a 'java-based scalar' (otherwise, it is a non-composite mirror),
and this allows byte order to be specified separately for scalars
and mirrors: historically, it was always bigendian regardless of
architecture. Presumably that has never mattered much for java-based
scalars (because PostgreSQL itself doesn't have any independent way
of seeing into them, so no inconsistency was visible), but for a
mirror type it is definitely broken if the hardware is not bigendian,
with PostgreSQL and Java not seeing the values the same way.

Therefore, this change leaves the scalar default (for 1.5.0 at least)
at bigendian, in case some sites may have used Java-based scalars in
the past and have tables that contain them. Also, the current UDT
implementation gives every scalar type a binary send/receive/COPY
format that can't (yet) be decoupled from its internal stored form, and
the PostgreSQL docs specify big-endian for those binary transfer formats,
so it would be premature to change the scalar byte-order default before
it is also possible to have a separate transfer format.

For mirror types, on the other hand, the default is here immediately
changed to native ... it is less likely that sites were heavily
using mirror UDTs if they were seeing bogus values, and this will
make them work right by default.

Java properties are used (set with -D in the pljava.vmoptions GUC):
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder  to set everything the same,

org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.scalar
org.postgresql.pljava.udt.byteorder.mirror  to set them separately.

The allowable values for each property are big_endian, little_endian,
and native.

A simple test with a PL/Java function declared PARALLEL SAFE,
and used in a parallel query, did just what it says on the tin,
on the first try.

There may still be cases lurking in which PL/Java's inner workings
would do something a SAFE or RESTRICTED function isn't supposed to
do, but I had imagined there would be problems galore and there aren't,
so the capability may as well be announced and documented./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2005-01-23 09:35:11+00:00,src/java5/pljava/org/postgresql/pljava/annotation/Function.java,pljava-api/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/annotation/Function.java,/2013-02-28 13:30:33-05:00,nan,nan,2016-10-30T03:03:05Z/,added/renamed

signature for assignRowValues can't just be changed.

Instead, for now, a ResultSetProvider is limited to returning INT_MAX
rows, but the limit is checked to ensure a predictable failure.

For the future, in the Java 8 world, the ResultSetProvider interface
could grow a default method largeAssignRowValues that takes a long
row number; the Java 8 default implementation would just signal the
same error, and classes implementing the old interface won't break.
Alas, PL/Java isn't committed to supporting only Java 8 yet.

In fact, the same thing could be done on the quiet: PL/Java could check
whether the class implementing ResultSetProvider happens to have a
largeAssignRowValues method with the right signature, and use it if
present. It would simply have to be covered in documentation, and not
formally declared in the interface until the Java support bar moves to
Java 8.

set up.

Detect that case and bail from the initsequencer as soon as possible
(right after defining the custom GUCs), leaving all the rest to be
completed when (if!) any actual call arrives at the call handler.

This prevents a baffling failure in parallel queries that make no use
of PL/Java; even better, it also avoids starting JVMs unnecessarily in
parallel queries that aren't going to use them./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-01-07 11:10:33+00:00,src/C/pljava/Backend.c,pljava-so/src/main/c/Backend.c,/2004-01-16 17:33:46+00:00/2004-01-20 19:52:11+00:00/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,nan,nan,2016-10-27T06:02:46Z/,added/renamed/renamed/renamed

Do away with never-documented, long-broken LargeObject code./Do away with never-documented LargeObject code.

In the run-up to releasing 1.5.0, the code to do with large objects
was looked over in a very conservative and cautious way, as fits
code that was never documented or presented as API and didn't have
any test coverage, with little way of knowing whether some client
code somewhere in the wild might have been developed around it.
So, it got carefully updated to 64-bit offsets, and even had a
vulnerability reported because it hadn't been updated to honor
the object access controls added in 9.0.

What all that very conservative analysis failed to notice was,
thanks to a change made back in 77bfc34, coupled with the absence
of test coverage, it has been about eleven years since the last
chance anyone ever had of doing anything useful with a LargeObject
instance. That makes the decision to do away with it much easier.

In all the PostgreSQL versions PL/Java currently supports, all the
functions needed to manipulate large objects are already exposed in
SQL and usable through the JDBC/SPI, without any specific effort
needed in PL/Java. For programming convenience, some later version
(after Java 7 becomes the minimum requirement) could add a simple
utility method to turn an integer LO fd from lo_open into a
SeekableByteChannel that could then be used without further trips
through SPI, but even that would be about optimization and convenience,
not functionality./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-11-27 23:08:54+00:00,src/java/pljava/org/postgresql/pljava/internal/LargeObject.java,pljava/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/internal/LargeObject.java,/2013-01-13 16:59:58-08:00,/2017-06-12 22:50:04-04:00,nan,2017-06-14T02:17:18Z/2017-06-13T02:50:04Z/,added/renamed/removed

Do away with never-documented, long-broken LargeObject code./Do away with never-documented LargeObject code.

In the run-up to releasing 1.5.0, the code to do with large objects
was looked over in a very conservative and cautious way, as fits
code that was never documented or presented as API and didn't have
any test coverage, with little way of knowing whether some client
code somewhere in the wild might have been developed around it.
So, it got carefully updated to 64-bit offsets, and even had a
vulnerability reported because it hadn't been updated to honor
the object access controls added in 9.0.

What all that very conservative analysis failed to notice was,
thanks to a change made back in 77bfc34, coupled with the absence
of test coverage, it has been about eleven years since the last
chance anyone ever had of doing anything useful with a LargeObject
instance. That makes the decision to do away with it much easier.

In all the PostgreSQL versions PL/Java currently supports, all the
functions needed to manipulate large objects are already exposed in
SQL and usable through the JDBC/SPI, without any specific effort
needed in PL/Java. For programming convenience, some later version
(after Java 7 becomes the minimum requirement) could add a simple
utility method to turn an integer LO fd from lo_open into a
SeekableByteChannel that could then be used without further trips
through SPI, but even that would be about optimization and convenience,
not functionality./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-11-27 23:08:54+00:00,src/C/include/pljava/type/LargeObject.h,pljava-so/src/main/include/pljava/type/LargeObject.h,/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,/2017-06-12 22:50:04-04:00,nan,2017-06-14T02:17:18Z/2017-06-13T02:50:04Z/,added/renamed/removed

Do away with never-documented, long-broken LargeObject code./Do away with never-documented LargeObject code.

In the run-up to releasing 1.5.0, the code to do with large objects
was looked over in a very conservative and cautious way, as fits
code that was never documented or presented as API and didn't have
any test coverage, with little way of knowing whether some client
code somewhere in the wild might have been developed around it.
So, it got carefully updated to 64-bit offsets, and even had a
vulnerability reported because it hadn't been updated to honor
the object access controls added in 9.0.

What all that very conservative analysis failed to notice was,
thanks to a change made back in 77bfc34, coupled with the absence
of test coverage, it has been about eleven years since the last
chance anyone ever had of doing anything useful with a LargeObject
instance. That makes the decision to do away with it much easier.

In all the PostgreSQL versions PL/Java currently supports, all the
functions needed to manipulate large objects are already exposed in
SQL and usable through the JDBC/SPI, without any specific effort
needed in PL/Java. For programming convenience, some later version
(after Java 7 becomes the minimum requirement) could add a simple
utility method to turn an integer LO fd from lo_open into a
SeekableByteChannel that could then be used without further trips
through SPI, but even that would be about optimization and convenience,
not functionality./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-11-27 23:08:54+00:00,src/C/pljava/type/LargeObject.c,pljava-so/src/main/c/type/LargeObject.c,/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,/2017-06-12 22:50:04-04:00,nan,2017-06-14T02:17:18Z/2017-06-13T02:50:04Z/,added/renamed/removed

Do away with never-documented, long-broken LargeObject code./Do away with never-documented LargeObject code.

In the run-up to releasing 1.5.0, the code to do with large objects
was looked over in a very conservative and cautious way, as fits
code that was never documented or presented as API and didn't have
any test coverage, with little way of knowing whether some client
code somewhere in the wild might have been developed around it.
So, it got carefully updated to 64-bit offsets, and even had a
vulnerability reported because it hadn't been updated to honor
the object access controls added in 9.0.

What all that very conservative analysis failed to notice was,
thanks to a change made back in 77bfc34, coupled with the absence
of test coverage, it has been about eleven years since the last
chance anyone ever had of doing anything useful with a LargeObject
instance. That makes the decision to do away with it much easier.

In all the PostgreSQL versions PL/Java currently supports, all the
functions needed to manipulate large objects are already exposed in
SQL and usable through the JDBC/SPI, without any specific effort
needed in PL/Java. For programming convenience, some later version
(after Java 7 becomes the minimum requirement) could add a simple
utility method to turn an integer LO fd from lo_open into a
SeekableByteChannel that could then be used without further trips
through SPI, but even that would be about optimization and convenience,
not functionality./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-01-07 11:10:33+00:00,src/C/pljava/type/Type.c,pljava-so/src/main/c/type/Type.c,/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,nan,nan,2017-06-14T02:17:18Z/2017-06-13T02:50:04Z/,added/renamed

The magic that makes tableOld/tableNew appear to exist under
the chosen names, for purposes of queries in SPI, happens when
SPI_register_trigger_data is called, passing the TriggerData
struct that was passed to the handler function, and that struct
has the chosen names and the tuplestores.

PL/Java doesn't do SPI_connect unless and until the called Java
function wants to use the jdbc:default:connection, at which point
the connection is created in Invocation.c and remembered for the
current level. So, that's a fine place to call SPI_register_trigger_data.
The TriggerData struct simply needs to be stashed in the current

PL/Java's internal JDBC driver was forked from pgjdbc a long time ago,
and there's a lot wrong with the nativeSQL method. It gives a meaning to
backslash that isn't from the SQL or JDBC standards, it has no knowledge
of standard JDBC escapes, or the difference between standard-conforming
and e-quoted strings, or Unicode strings, or dollar-quoted strings, or
continuation of string literals. Bringing it all to spec would be far
too much change for a minor PL/Java release.

All that being said, this particular quoting issue is a simple, obvious
bug among bugs, and has been reported, so it is clearly in somebody's
way, so no objection to fixing it here, though it leaves nativeSQL() for
now only slightly less wrong./Fix #136 SPIConnection prepareStatement doesn't recognize all parameters

Ensure, when returning RECORD or SETOF RECORD, that returned values
are cast according to the types in the column definition list that SQL
requires in the query following the function call./Do casts in ResultSetHandle by column definition list

A function declared to return RECORD or SETOF RECORD is required
by SQL to be followed by a column definition list in any query using it.
If the function returns SETOF RECORD using ResultSetHandle, there is a
possibility that one or more corresponding columns in the definition list
and the ResultSet offered by ResultSetHandle differ in type. Let the type
be cast automatically, just as it would be when using ResultSetProvider
and storing each value into the output ResultSet.

Also convert the SetOfRecordTest example to an annotation-style example
and add an SQLAction that tests it.

Constraint triggers can be declared and are usable (the runtime will
deliver them; a trigger method should throw an exception to report that
a constraint would be violated); however, the TriggerData interface has
not been extended to expose any of the new contraint-trigger-specific
information to the called method./Merge pull request #142 from tada/bug/REL1_5_STABLE/issue142

Accomodate upstream SPI_push/pop API changes (issue #134)/Document (lack of) issue #134 regression test.

An obvious place to put it, in examples/Triggers.java, won't really
help, because those all run with SPI already connected and would not
catch the bug.

This is more of a note to the future, to make such a test when there
is more of a regression test infrastructure to run tests from outside

Ensure, when returning RECORD or SETOF RECORD, that returned values
are cast according to the types in the column definition list that SQL
requires in the query following the function call./Do casts in ResultSetHandle by column definition list

A function declared to return RECORD or SETOF RECORD is required
by SQL to be followed by a column definition list in any query using it.
If the function returns SETOF RECORD using ResultSetHandle, there is a
possibility that one or more corresponding columns in the definition list
and the ResultSet offered by ResultSetHandle differ in type. Let the type
be cast automatically, just as it would be when using ResultSetProvider
and storing each value into the output ResultSet.

Also convert the SetOfRecordTest example to an annotation-style example
and add an SQLAction that tests it.

The @SQLType annotation can now supply an array of strings as
defaultValue for a parameter that has a row type (either the RECORD
type, whose structure is unknown, or a named row type).

In the case of RECORD, the only default that will be accepted is
{} (the array of no strings). While a bit limiting, that is still
just the ticket when a RECORD-typed parameter is being used to
supply a function with an optional, arbitrary sequence of named, typed
parameters.

In the case of a named row type, the default should be an array of
as many strings as the components of the type, and the strings should
be castable to the corresponding component types. The DDR generator
has no way to check that at compile time, but PostgreSQL will report
the error at jar install time if there is a mismatch./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2013-02-28 13:55:00-05:00,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,2018-06-16T21:13:53Z/,added

It was never satisfying to define a UDT in Java through annotations
and still have the DDR generator give ""no mapping to an SQL type"" errors
for functions accepting or returning that type. It was easy enough (if
tedious) to work around by adding explicit type= or @SQLType annotations,
but the DDR generator had all the necessary information to figure that out
without such manual help. Now it does, eliminating the tedium
illustrated in jcflack/pljava-udt-type-extension@bcb5734.

To accommodate mappings added from the source being compiled, the
protoMappings collection is now of TypeMirror instances rather than
of Class instances.

Still future work: also add implied ordering dependencies for uses of
the new type (such as functions that have it as parameter or return
types and have to follow the type declaration, as illustrated in
jcflack/pljava-udt-type-extension@225ef5c, or that are named in it as,

Fix failure of the compile-time SQL generator to recognize bytea as the
SQL type corresponding to Java's byte[]. Also eliminates a longstanding
warning message./This fixes a problem but not the problem.

The name passed to getTypeElement is expected to be a canonical name,
but that isn't what Class.getName() returns (or there wouldn't be a
Class.getCanonicalName()).

However, the problem seems to be deeper; arrays are not listed among the
things TypeElements exist to represent. It may be necessary to drill down
to the component type and then construct the TypeMirror using
getArrayType()./Let annotations give row-type parameters defaults.

The @SQLType annotation can now supply an array of strings as
defaultValue for a parameter that has a row type (either the RECORD
type, whose structure is unknown, or a named row type).

In the case of RECORD, the only default that will be accepted is
{} (the array of no strings). While a bit limiting, that is still
just the ticket when a RECORD-typed parameter is being used to
supply a function with an optional, arbitrary sequence of named, typed
parameters.

In the case of a named row type, the default should be an array of
as many strings as the components of the type, and the strings should
be castable to the corresponding component types. The DDR generator
has no way to check that at compile time, but PostgreSQL will report
the error at jar install time if there is a mismatch./","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ","Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2005-01-23 10:56:36+00:00,pljava-api/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/sqlgen/DDRProcessor.java,pljava-api/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/annotation/processing/DDRProcessor.java,/2013-02-28 13:30:33-05:00/2020-01-17 19:28:09-05:00,nan,2018-07-17T03:59:30Z/2018-07-21T02:06:06Z/2018-04-28T22:35:15Z/,2018-07-21T02:06:06Z/2018-07-17T03:18:24Z/2018-06-16T21:13:53Z/2018-07-19T05:18:46Z/,added/renamed

As the current PreparedStatement implementation does not get the
inferred parameter types from PostgreSQL (which became possible
with SPI only as recently as PostgreSQL 9.0), its setObject method
must make a best effort to map in the other direction, finding the
PostgreSQL type that corresponds to the Java parameter value. In
one case, this is easily made much more reliable: when the Java
parameter value is an SQLData instance (a UDT), and therefore has
a getSQLTypeName method, unused until now.

For PreparedStatement.setObject(col, x, Types.SQLXML) to work,
it's sufficient to mention the type in Oid.c. Getting the type
back from the ResultSet already works, thanks to the
Type_registerType() already done in SQLXMLImpl.c. However, the
test in the getObject(col, SQLXML.class) needed fixing, as it was
testing exact class equality, not whether it got an implementation
of the desired interface. (In passing, reorder those methods to make
clearer what JDBC revision brought them in.)

The setObject overload without the explicit Types.SQLXML will not
work yet, and simply adding addType(SQLXML.class,Types.SQLXML)
in SPIConnection is not sufficient ... because that uses a hash
table and therefore also depends on exact class equality; the full
grody names of the implementing classes would have to be added.
Or the mechanism would have to be fixed.

Wondering why the out.updateObject(col, x) works, without giving
an explicit type? That result set is already typed (by the column
definition list you have to include in the query calling this
RECORD-typed function). That method succeeding is /almost/ enough
to make a subsequent ps.setObject(col, x) work right (because in
succeeding, it primed the s_class2typeId cache in Oid); how would
that be for spooky action at a distance? But that doesn't quite
happen, because that cache is also a strict-class-equality hash map.

At this point, implementing the various (get,set,update}SQLXML methods
will be an easy formality, as they can be implemented in terms of the
methods taking explicit types, which now work.

Alas, this current behavior won't do for a 1.5.x release, because it
would actually start producing SQLXML objects by default where old
code may be expecting String. Before merging, this will need a way
to suppress that automatic mapping but still allow the explicit kind.
A subsequent major release can then go the rest of the way./Sort implemented from unimplemented JDBC4 methods.

As the current PreparedStatement implementation does not get the
inferred parameter types from PostgreSQL (which became possible
with SPI only as recently as PostgreSQL 9.0), its setObject method
must make a best effort to map in the other direction, finding the
PostgreSQL type that corresponds to the Java parameter value. In
one case, this is easily made much more reliable: when the Java
parameter value is an SQLData instance (a UDT), and therefore has
a getSQLTypeName method, unused until now.

Supplies one of the short-term improvements suggested in issue #149./Use getSQLTypeName, and add a test.

Provide one of the short-term solutions suggested in issue #149.

As the current PreparedStatement implementation does not get the
inferred parameter types from PostgreSQL (which became possible
with SPI only as recently as PostgreSQL 9.0), its setObject method
must make a best effort to map in the other direction, finding the
PostgreSQL type that corresponds to the Java parameter value. In
one case, this is easily made much more reliable: when the Java
parameter value is an SQLData instance (a UDT), and therefore has
a getSQLTypeName method, unused until now.

Add a test method (in the ComplexTuple UDT example) to confirm that
the type is properly mapped when passed as a parameter to a
PreparedStatement./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2006-05-06 11:41:13+00:00,pljava-examples/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/example/ComplexTuple.java,pljava-examples/src/main/java/org/postgresql/pljava/example/annotation/ComplexTuple.java,/2013-01-13 16:48:40-08:00/2015-10-18 14:26:40-04:00,nan,nan,2018-07-21T02:06:06Z/2018-06-10T21:40:02Z/2018-06-01T17:07:58Z/,added/renamed/renamed

Enables conversion of negative (before the epoch) timestamp values,
which formerly threw an exception, so backward compatibility is not
an issue for that case.

Also avoids a double-counting of the fractional second, which can change
the conversion result from what it formerly would have been, by a maximum
of 1998 ms, average of 999 ms./Merge branch bug/REL1_5_STABLE/issue155 into HEAD

Necessary to get the timestamp/timestamptz conversions <-> XQuery types
right./Correct errors in Timestamp (issue #155).

Review the arithmetic to make sure 'floored' / and % are always done
to preserve the constraint that the 'nanos' component of the Java
Timestamp class is always nonnegative, and to avoid double-counting
the part of the fractional second that is represented in both the
millis and the nanos components.

Add SQLActions in the TypeRoundTripper to test this behavior.

For PreparedStatement.setObject(col, x, Types.SQLXML) to work,
it's sufficient to mention the type in Oid.c. Getting the type
back from the ResultSet already works, thanks to the
Type_registerType() already done in SQLXMLImpl.c. However, the
test in the getObject(col, SQLXML.class) needed fixing, as it was
testing exact class equality, not whether it got an implementation
of the desired interface. (In passing, reorder those methods to make
clearer what JDBC revision brought them in.)

The setObject overload without the explicit Types.SQLXML will not
work yet, and simply adding addType(SQLXML.class,Types.SQLXML)
in SPIConnection is not sufficient ... because that uses a hash
table and therefore also depends on exact class equality; the full
grody names of the implementing classes would have to be added.
Or the mechanism would have to be fixed.

Wondering why the out.updateObject(col, x) works, without giving
an explicit type? That result set is already typed (by the column
definition list you have to include in the query calling this
RECORD-typed function). That method succeeding is /almost/ enough
to make a subsequent ps.setObject(col, x) work right (because in
succeeding, it primed the s_class2typeId cache in Oid); how would
that be for spooky action at a distance? But that doesn't quite
happen, because that cache is also a strict-class-equality hash map.

At this point, implementing the various (get,set,update}SQLXML methods
will be an easy formality, as they can be implemented in terms of the
methods taking explicit types, which now work.

Alas, this current behavior won't do for a 1.5.x release, because it
would actually start producing SQLXML objects by default where old
code may be expecting String. Before merging, this will need a way
to suppress that automatic mapping but still allow the explicit kind.
A subsequent major release can then go the rest of the way./",nan,"Chapman Flack/chap@anastigmatix.net, ",2004-01-07 11:10:33+00:00,src/C/pljava/type/Oid.c,pljava-so/src/main/c/type/Oid.c,/2013-02-21 23:10:44+01:00,nan,nan,2018-05-30T03:42:25Z/,added/renamed
